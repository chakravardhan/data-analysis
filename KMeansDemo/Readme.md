This small Shiny application demonstrates Shiny's automatic UI updates.

Change the Number of Clusters, X or Y variable and notice how the renderPlot expression is automatically re-evaluated when its dependant changes, causing a new plot to render with the selected variables and number of clusters.

*IMPORTANT INFO*
Right now this app is running in showcase mode. To disable showcase mode, change DisplayMode value in DESCRIPTION file.
